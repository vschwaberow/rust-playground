# rust-playground

Welcome to the rust-playground repository! This repository contains various samples and experiments in the Rust programming language.

## What is Rust?

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. It is a statically typed language, meaning that types are checked at compile-time rather than runtime. Rust also has a strong emphasis on ownership and borrowing, which helps prevent null or dangling pointer references and makes it easier to write safe and concurrent code.

## What's in this repository?

The rust-playground repository contains a variety of examples and exercises that showcase different features and concepts in Rust. Some examples you may find in this repository include:

- Basic syntax and data types
- Ownership and borrowing
- Concurrency and parallelism
- Unsafe code and FFI (Foreign Function Interface)
- Web development with Rust
- And more!
