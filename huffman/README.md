# Huffman Tree in Rust

This is an example implementation of a Huffman tree in Rust. A Huffman tree is a data structure used for lossless data compression. It works by assigning shorter encodings to more frequent characters in the input text, resulting in a smaller overall encoding size.

## Usage

To use this code, you will need to have Rust installed on your system. You can then clone this repository and build the code using `cargo build` or run the code using `cargo run`.
